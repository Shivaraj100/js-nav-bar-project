  <h1>Fitness Hacks</h1>
  
  <div class="fitness">

    <h3>Meal Prep and Plan:</h3>
    <p>Spend some time each week to plan and prepare your meals in advance. This helps you make healthier food choices, control portion sizes, and avoid relying on fast food or unhealthy options when you're busy. Prepare nutritious meals and snacks in advance, portion them out, and store them in convenient containers for easy access throughout the week.</p>

    <h3>Practice Mindful Eating:</h3>
    <p> Paying attention to your eating habits can make a significant difference in your fitness journey. Slow down and savor each bite, chewing thoroughly and being mindful of your body's hunger and fullness cues. Avoid distractions while eating, such as screens or multitasking, as this can lead to mindless overeating. Listen to your body and eat until you're satisfied, not overly full.</p>

    <h3>Drink Plenty of Water:</h3>
    <p>Staying hydrated is crucial for overall health and fitness. Make it a habit to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Keep a water bottle with you and take regular sips to stay hydrated and maintain optimal bodily functions, including energy levels and muscle recovery.</p>

    <h3>Take Active Breaks:</h3>
    <p>Incorporate short bursts of physical activity throughout your day. Instead of sitting for long periods, take active breaks by stretching, doing a few minutes of bodyweight exercises, or going for a quick walk. These active breaks help break up sedentary behavior and add movement to your routine.</p>

    <h3>Practice Portion Control:</h3>
    <p>Pay attention to portion sizes when it comes to meals and snacks. Use smaller plates or bowls to visually trick yourself into consuming smaller portions. Focus on nutrient-dense foods like vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, and be mindful of your hunger and fullness cues to avoid overeating.</p>
